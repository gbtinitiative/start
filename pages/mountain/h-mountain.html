            you've made it! i'm impressed. congratulations, birthday girl!

            <br><br>you've turned 17 years old today (or a few days ago, depending on how long it took you to complete this). how does it feel to be another year older? i can't imagine it feels much different, but i won't know for another six months. no spoilers, please.

            <br><br>i've been planning this for a few months, and actively working on it for the past few weeks. a lot has happened in that time. but regardless of everything, it was very important to me to finish this and get it out for your birthday. you're a very special person, and a big part of who i am today. it didn't feel right to buy you a present and call it a day.

            <br><br>you once made me the most beautiful birthday present i could've wished for. i didn't cherish it as much as i should have at the time, and i'm sorry for that. i thought i owed you something special too. i'm no artist or writer, i'm the Computer Guy, so this is what i could come up with. i tried my best to make something i thought you'd enjoy. i hope you did!

            <br><br>in these past 2 (3?) years, i've learned a lot about you. you're smart and funny. you care a lot about people. you're extremely thoughtful and tactful, sometimes to the point of complete absurdity. you have terrible taste in food. you have great taste in tv shows. you have strange phobias. your voice speeds up when you're talking about something you're excited about and it's the most wonderful thing in the world. you have a way of making people smile. your happiness is infectious - it's physically impossible to be down when you're around. what i'm trying to say is that it's very hard not to like you. you're an amazing friend and a fascinating person. you should know just how much you're worth to the people who care about you.

            <br><br>there's not much left of high school, and most of us will never see each other again in a bit more than a year. regardless, i want you to know that you've left a mark on all of us and given us many memories to cherish. in the far future, no matter where i am or how i am or who i've become, when your name crosses my mind and your face pops up i'll think about the time we spent together and it'll put a big, stupid smile on my face. i hope i can do the same thing for you one day. i could never thank you enough for the memories you've given me.

            <br><br>i wish you a very happy birthday and a very happy life. thank you for being you. we appreciate it.
